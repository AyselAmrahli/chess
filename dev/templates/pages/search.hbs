                        The International Chess Federation is pleased to announce a new major competition: the FIDE Online Olympiad 2020, to be held between July 25nd and August 30th, 2020.
                    </b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Online Olympiad is a national teams event in which all federations affiliated to FIDE have the right to participate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each team will consist of six players, in a mixed format with a minimum of three female players and two junior players.
                </p>

                <p>

                    <b>Specifically, each team must include:</b>
                    - at least 1 player U-20 (born in 2000 or later)
                    - at least 2 women
                    - at least 1 girl U-20 (born in 2000 or later)
                </p>

                <p>
                    The teams may have up to six reserves, plus a team captain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The time control for this event will be 15 minutes + 5 seconds increment per move.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The event will consist of two main stages: the “Divisions stage”, and the Play-offs stage, from Round of 16 to the final.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since the Online Olympiad is a mixed event, for pairing purposes the ranking will be established in accordance with the final standings of the last “Gaprindashvili Cup”, which combines the results in the open and women’s sections at the Batumi Chess Olympiad 2018.
                </p>

                    Baku is a capital of the Republic of Azerbaijan. It is one of the largest industrial, scientific and cultural center not only of the country, as well as in the entire region. It is a major port on the west coast of the Caspian Sea, in the southern part of the Absheron Peninsula.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is a lively and very interesting city, where life does not stop even at night. Over the last ten years, Baku has greatly changed: new multi-storey buildings of shopping centers, hotels and banks harmonize very well with the old buildings. Baku is divided into 11 administrative districts.

                    Addressing the ceremony afterwards, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov thanked the State of Azerbaijan for the high level of organization of the 42nd Chess Olympiad. “The organizers of the Chess Olympiad have set a very high standard of conducting high-profile chess tournaments. Organizers of future Olympiads have a very tall task of emulating this level. Today we are closing this remarkable holiday but are convinced that thousands of boys and girls will come to chess clubs tomorrow to discover the secrets of the most intelligent game of the planet. And we will have the opportunity to return to this hospitable land to witness new battles in other tournaments,” he said.

                <p>
                    Expressing his gratitude to President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev for his continued support of chess, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said Azerbaijan had always hosted prestigious international competitions at a high level. He noted that chess players and other visitors were leaving Azerbaijan with very good impressions.

                    Minister of Youth and Sport of Azerbaijan Azad Rahimov and Minister of Sport and Youth Affairs of Georgia Tariel Khachikashvili were then invited to the stage for the handover of the FIDE flag to the next Olympiad host country.

                    In conclusion of his speech, the Georgian minister thanked the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) for its support of the development of sport in Georgia, including chess.
